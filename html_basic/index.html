  <h1>Welcome to My Web Page</h1>

  <p>This is a simple web page designed to demonstrate HTML structure using headings, paragraphs, and images. HTML stands for HyperText Markup Language and is the foundation of most websites today.</p>

  <h2>Why HTML Matters</h2>

  <p>HTML allows developers to create structured content for the web. By using different heading levels, paragraphs, and images, developers ensure users can easily read and navigate the site. Semantic tags also help with accessibility and search engine optimization.</p>

  <h3>Using Clickable Images</h3>

  <p>One powerful feature of HTML is the ability to turn images into clickable links. This is done by placing an image tag (`<img>`) inside an anchor tag (`<a>`). You can link to any external website or even another section of the same page.</p>

  <p>Below is a clickable image that links to the ALX website, a global tech training platform:</p>
